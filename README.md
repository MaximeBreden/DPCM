This folder contains the Matlab codes associated with the paper "Existence of traveling waves solutions for the Diffusion Poisson Coupled Model: a computer-assisted proof", by M. Breden C. Chainais-Hillairet and A. Zurek. 

All the computer-assisted parts of the proof discussed in the paper can be reproduced by running script_proof.m.
In order to get guaranteed results, you need to use [Intlab](https://www.tuhh.de/ti3/rump/intlab/). If you don't you can still run the code, but the output won't be certified.
